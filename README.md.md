## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my third completed design through frontendmentor. I can feel myself getting more comfortable replicating designs. 

Overall I can feel myself improving and I am so thankful for the opportunity to practcie like this. 

### Continued development

I realize I definitely need to work on making my sites mobile responsive to different screen sizes, and working with Flexbox and CSS grid. Though I know a lot about them, not everything I do works correctly and I'd like to learn how to organize it better to make it the most responsive. The next one I create I will heavily focus on CSS grid and responsive design.
